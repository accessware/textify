# textify

Python library to convert many common document types to plane text.

## Todo:

* Add DOCX parsing.
* Add PPTX parsing.
* Add HTML parsing.
* Add EPub parsing
* Add Markdown parsing.
* Add CHM parsing.
* Add BRF and BRL support.
* Add PDF support.
* Add Mobi ebook support.
* Omit the need for python -m before calling textify from the command line (I've seen it done before just can't figure out how).
